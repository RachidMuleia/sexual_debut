# sexual_debut
Here we present the R code to run the analysis for our paper on sexual debut. The model applied here is a geoadditive model where the spatial component is modelled using radial basis splines. Our work stems from the paper of Ganguli & Wand on Additive models for geo-referenced failure time data. 
Here We share the R code to fit the geoadditive model for survival outcome. The code is made of three two file, an R code to construct the Z matrix and an R code to fit the model via poisson approximation. Additionally we present the code to create the Maps.
